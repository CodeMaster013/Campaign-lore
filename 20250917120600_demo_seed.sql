  # Demo Seed Data

  This migration seeds demo-friendly data for quick testing and previews.
  Safe to re-run: uses upserts or NOT EXISTS guards where applicable.

  Includes:
  - Demo users aligned with app mock credentials
  - A few missions, NPCs, star systems, session notes, communications, and lore entries

  Run with Supabase CLI:
    supabase db reset        -- to rebuild fresh including seeds
    # or
    supabase db push         -- to apply new migrations
